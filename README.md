# Exploring Profitable Free iOS & Android Apps

My first guided project in my Python Programming Course. The goal of working on this project was to gain an outlook on what a job as a data scientist may look like. The hands-on experience provided more familiarity with Jupyter Notebook! My favorite part was learning about the ASCII Table since this can come in handy in the future.

## Usage
This is intended as a learning resource! This is just my take on this project.
