# Guided-Project-Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets
My first guided project, in my Python Programming Course. 

The goal of working on this project was:

To gain an outlook on what a job for a data scientist may look like. The hands on experience
provided more familiarity with Jupyter Notebook! My favorite part was learning about ASCII Table
since this can come in handy for the future.

## Usage
This is intended as a learning resource! This is just my take on this project. The creator of this code takes no responsibility whatsoever of any concequences you may face after claiming this code to be yours, or getting laughed at by your teacher.
